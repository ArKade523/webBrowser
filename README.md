# My Custom Web Browser

Welcome to the repository for My Custom Web Browser, a lightweight, customizable web browser built from scratch using C++ and SDL for rendering. This project aims to provide a basic but expandable web browsing experience, focusing on the fundamentals of web rendering and browser architecture.

## Features

- **HTML Parsing**: Custom-built HTML parser to interpret and process HTML files.
- **Font Management**: Integrated FontManager to handle various font styles and sizes dynamically.
- **Basic Rendering**: Utilizes SDL for rendering HTML content, supporting text and basic shapes.
- **Resizable Window**: SDL-based GUI that supports window resizing to accommodate different viewing needs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software:

- SDL2
- SDL2_ttf (for font rendering)
- C++17 compiler (GCC or Clang)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-custom-web-browser.git
   cd my-custom-web-browser
   ```
2. Install SDL2 and SDL2_ttf:
   On Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
  ```

  On macOS (using Homebrew):
  ```bash
  brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf
  ```
3. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
4. Run the browser:
   ```bash
   ./webBrowser
   ```
## Usage

To use the browser, simply run the executable generated by the compilation process. If you want to open a specific HTML file, you can pass the file path as an argument:

```bash
./webBrowser path/to/your/file.html
```
